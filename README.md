Obtain the degree distribution of a static graph (in MTX format).

In this experiment, we measure the **degree distribution** of a number of
**static graph datasets**. As logging all the degrees of a graph is *not*
*feasible*, we *compress the degree distribution* into **blocks** (or *bins*)
such that there are a total of **256 blocks**. The degree distribution is then
measured by counting the number of nodes in each block.

The results show that in general graphs have a **dual power-law degree**
**distribution**, i.e., the degree distribution follows a power-law distribution
in the **low-degree region** and another power-law distribution in the
**high-degree region**. The transition point between the two power-law regions
can be called the **knee** of the degree distribution, and can be determiner of
the performance of graph algorithms.

All outputs are saved in a [gist] and a small part of the output is listed here.
Some [charts] are also included below, generated from [sheets].
